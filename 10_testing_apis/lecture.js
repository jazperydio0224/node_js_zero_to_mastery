/* TESTING IN NODE */
/* 
1. Test runner - finds all of the tests through our projects, runs through them and gives the result
2. Test fixtures - how tests are setup/organized by module
3. Assertions - allow us to check for example, that we expect 5 + 5 to be equal to the number 10
4. Mocking - For example we have a database, that creates, reads and updates hundreds of tests in that database (affects data temporarily)
